 * 
 * Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

	A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
	
	 
	
	Example 1:
	
	Input: s = "aab"
	Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
	Example 2:
	
	Input: s = "a"
	Output: [["a"]]
	 
	
	Constraints:
	
	1 <= s.length <= 16
	s contains only lowercase English letters.
